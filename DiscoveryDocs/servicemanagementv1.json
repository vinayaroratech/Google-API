It is used by\n[gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:\n\n- Simple to use and understand for most users\n- Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs\n\n# Overview\n\nThe `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,\nand error details. The error code should be an enum value of\ngoogle.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The\nerror message should be a developer-facing English message that helps\ndevelopers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing\nerror message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or\nlocalize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary\ninformation about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types\nin the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.\n\n# Language mapping\n\nThe `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it\nis not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is\nexposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be\nmapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions\nin Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.\n\n# Other uses\n\nThe error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of\nenvironments, either with or without APIs, to provide a\nconsistent developer experience across different environments.\n\nExample uses of this error model include:\n\n- Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,\n    it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial\n    errors.\n\n- Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may\n    have a `Status` message for error reporting.\n\n- Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the\n    `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for\n    each error sub-response.\n\n- Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation\n    results in its response, the status of those operations should be\n    represented directly using the `Status` message.\n\n- Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could\n    be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.","enum":null,"enumDescriptions":null,"format":null,"id":"Status","items":null,"location":null,"maximum":null,"minimum":null,"pattern":null,"properties":{"details":{"$ref":null,"additionalProperties":null,"annotations":null,"default":null,"description":"A list of messages that carry the error details.

The mapping specifies how different portions of the RPC\nrequest message are mapped to URL path, URL query parameters, and\nHTTP request body. The mapping is typically specified as an\n`google.api.http` annotation on the RPC method,\nsee \"google/api/annotations.proto\" for details.\n\nThe mapping consists of a field specifying the path template and\nmethod kind.  The path template can refer to fields in the request\nmessage, as in the example below which describes a REST GET\noperation on a resource collection of messages:\n\n\n    service Messaging {\n      rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {\n        option (google.api.http).get = \"/v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield}\";\n      }\n    }\n    message GetMessageRequest {\n      message SubMessage {\n        string subfield = 1;\n      }\n      string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL\n      SubMessage sub = 2;    // `sub.subfield` is url-mapped\n    }\n    message Message {\n      string text = 1; // content of the resource\n    }\n\nThe same http annotation can alternatively be expressed inside the\n`GRPC API Configuration` YAML file.\n\n    http:\n      rules:\n        - selector: <proto_package_name>.Messaging.GetMessage\n          get: /v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield}\n\nThis definition enables an automatic, bidrectional mapping of HTTP\nJSON to RPC. Example:\n\nHTTP | RPC\n-----|-----\n`GET /v1/messages/123456/foo`  | `GetMessage(message_id: \"123456\" sub: SubMessage(subfield: \"foo\"))`\n\nIn general, not only fields but also field paths can be referenced\nfrom a path pattern. Fields mapped to the path pattern cannot be\nrepeated and must have a primitive (non-message) type.\n\nAny fields in the request message which are not bound by the path\npattern automatically become (optional) HTTP query\nparameters. Assume the following definition of the request message:\n\n\n    service Messaging {\n      rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {\n        option (google.api.http).get = \"/v1/messages/{message_id}\";\n      }\n    }\n    message GetMessageRequest {\n      message SubMessage {\n        string subfield = 1;\n      }\n      string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL\n      int64 revision = 2;    // becomes a parameter\n      SubMessage sub = 3;    // `sub.subfield` becomes a parameter\n    }\n\n\nThis enables a HTTP JSON to RPC mapping as below:\n\nHTTP | RPC\n-----|-----\n`GET /v1/messages/123456?revision=2&sub.subfield=foo` | `GetMessage(message_id: \"123456\" revision: 2 sub: SubMessage(subfield: \"foo\"))`\n\nNote that fields which are mapped to HTTP parameters must have a\nprimitive type or a repeated primitive type. Message types are not\nallowed. In the case of a repeated type, the parameter can be\nrepeated in the URL, as in `...?param=A&param=B`.\n\nFor HTTP method kinds which allow a request body, the `body` field\nspecifies the mapping. Consider a REST update method on the\nmessage resource collection:\n\n\n    service Messaging {\n      rpc UpdateMessage(UpdateMessageRequest) returns (Message) {\n        option (google.api.http) = {\n          put: \"/v1/messages/{message_id}\"\n          body: \"message\"\n        };\n      }\n    }\n    message UpdateMessageRequest {\n      string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL\n      Message message = 2;   // mapped to the body\n    }\n\n\nThe following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled, where the\nrepresentation of the JSON in the request body is determined by\nprotos JSON encoding:\n\nHTTP | RPC\n-----|-----\n`PUT /v1/messages/123456 { \"text\": \"Hi!\" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id: \"123456\" message { text: \"Hi!\" })`\n\nThe special name `*` can be used in the body mapping to define that\nevery field not bound by the path template should be mapped to the\nrequest body.  This enables the following alternative definition of\nthe update method:\n\n    service Messaging {\n      rpc UpdateMessage(Message) returns (Message) {\n        option (google.api.http) = {\n          put: \"/v1/messages/{message_id}\"\n          body: \"*\"\n        };\n      }\n    }\n    message Message {\n      string message_id = 1;\n      string text = 2;\n    }\n\n\nThe following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled:\n\nHTTP | RPC\n-----|-----\n`PUT /v1/messages/123456 { \"text\": \"Hi!\" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id: \"123456\" text: \"Hi!\")`\n\nNote that when using `*` in the body mapping, it is not possible to\nhave HTTP parameters, as all fields not bound by the path end in\nthe body. This makes this option more rarely used in practice of\ndefining REST APIs. The common usage of `*` is in custom methods\nwhich don't use the URL at all for transferring data.\n\nIt is possible to define multiple HTTP methods for one RPC by using\nthe `additional_bindings` option. Example:\n\n    service Messaging {\n      rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {\n        option (google.api.http) = {\n          get: \"/v1/messages/{message_id}\"\n          additional_bindings {\n            get: \"/v1/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}\"\n          }\n        };\n      }\n    }\n    message GetMessageRequest {\n      string message_id = 1;\n      string user_id = 2;\n    }\n\n\nThis enables the following two alternative HTTP JSON to RPC\nmappings:\n\nHTTP | RPC\n-----|-----\n`GET /v1/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(message_id: \"123456\")`\n`GET /v1/users/me/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(user_id: \"me\" message_id: \"123456\")`\n\n# Rules for HTTP mapping\n\nThe rules for mapping HTTP path, query parameters, and body fields\nto the request message are as follows:\n\n1. The `body` field specifies either `*` or a field path, or is\n   omitted. If omitted, it indicates there is no HTTP request body.\n2. Leaf fields (recursive expansion of nested messages in the\n   request) can be classified into three types:\n    (a) Matched in the URL template.\n    (b) Covered by body (if body is `*`, everything except (a) fields;\n        else everything under the body field)\n    (c) All other fields.\n3. URL query parameters found in the HTTP request are mapped to (c) fields.\n4. Any body sent with an HTTP request can contain only (b) fields.\n\nThe syntax of the path template is as follows:\n\n    Template = \"/\" Segments [ Verb ] ;\n    Segments = Segment { \"/\" Segment } ;\n    Segment  = \"*\" | \"**\" | LITERAL | Variable ;\n    Variable = \"{\" FieldPath [ \"=\" Segments ] \"}\" ;\n    FieldPath = IDENT { \".\" IDENT } ;\n    Verb     = \":\" LITERAL ;\n\nThe syntax `*` matches a single path segment. The syntax `**` matches zero\nor more path segments, which must be the last part of the path except the\n`Verb`. The syntax `LITERAL` matches literal text in the path.\n\nThe syntax `Variable` matches part of the URL path as specified by its\ntemplate. A variable template must not contain other variables. If a variable\nmatches a single path segment, its template may be omitted, e.g. `{var}`\nis equivalent to `{var=*}`.\n\nIf a variable contains exactly one path segment, such as `\"{var}\"` or\n`\"{var=*}\"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path, all characters\nexcept `[-_.~0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded. Such variables show up in the\nDiscovery Document as `{var}`.\n\nIf a variable contains one or more path segments, such as `\"{var=foo/*}\"`\nor `\"{var=**}\"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path, all\ncharacters except `[-_.~/0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded. Such variables\nshow up in the Discovery Document as `{+var}`.\n\nNOTE: While the single segment variable matches the semantics of\n[RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section 3.2.2\nSimple String Expansion, the multi segment variable **does not** match\nRFC 6570 Reserved Expansion. The reason is that the Reserved Expansion\ndoes not expand special characters like `?` and `#`, which would lead\nto invalid URLs.\n\nNOTE: the field paths in variables and in the `body` must not refer to\nrepeated fields or map fields.","enum":null,"enumDescriptions":null,"format":null,"id":"HttpRule","items":null,"location":null,"maximum":null,"minimum":null,"pattern":null,"properties":{"mediaUpload":{"$ref":"MediaUpload","additionalProperties":null,"annotations":null,"default":null,"description":"Use this only for Scotty Requests.
