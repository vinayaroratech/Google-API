It is used by\n[gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:\n\n- Simple to use and understand for most users\n- Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs\n\n# Overview\n\nThe `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,\nand error details. The error code should be an enum value of\ngoogle.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The\nerror message should be a developer-facing English message that helps\ndevelopers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing\nerror message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or\nlocalize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary\ninformation about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types\nin the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.\n\n# Language mapping\n\nThe `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it\nis not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is\nexposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be\nmapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions\nin Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.\n\n# Other uses\n\nThe error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of\nenvironments, either with or without APIs, to provide a\nconsistent developer experience across different environments.\n\nExample uses of this error model include:\n\n- Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,\n    it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial\n    errors.\n\n- Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may\n    have a `Status` message for error reporting.\n\n- Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the\n    `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for\n    each error sub-response.\n\n- Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation\n    results in its response, the status of those operations should be\n    represented directly using the `Status` message.\n\n- Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could\n    be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.","enum":null,"enumDescriptions":null,"format":null,"id":"GoogleRpc__Status","items":null,"location":null,"maximum":null,"minimum":null,"pattern":null,"properties":{"message":{"$ref":null,"additionalProperties":null,"annotations":null,"default":null,"description":"A developer-facing error message, which should be in English.

To send binary data, you must\nbase64-encode the data and mark it as binary. To mark a JSON string\nas binary, replace it with a JSON object with a single attribute named `b64`:\n<pre>{\"b64\": \"...\"} </pre>\nFor example:\n\nTwo Serialized tf.Examples (fake data, for illustrative purposes only):\n<pre>\n{\"instances\": [{\"b64\": \"X5ad6u\"}, {\"b64\": \"IA9j4nx\"}]}\n</pre>\nTwo JPEG image byte strings (fake data, for illustrative purposes only):\n<pre>\n{\"instances\": [{\"b64\": \"ASa8asdf\"}, {\"b64\": \"JLK7ljk3\"}]}\n</pre>\nIf your data includes named references, format each instance as a JSON object\nwith the named references as the keys:\n\nJSON input data to be preprocessed:\n<pre>\n{\n  \"instances\": [\n    {\n      \"a\": 1.0,\n      \"b\": true,\n      \"c\": \"x\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"a\": -2.0,\n      \"b\": false,\n      \"c\": \"y\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</pre>\nSome models have an underlying TensorFlow graph that accepts multiple input\ntensors. In this case, you should use the names of JSON name/value pairs to\nidentify the input tensors, as shown in the following exmaples:\n\nFor a graph with input tensor aliases \"tag\" (string) and \"image\"\n(base64-encoded string):\n<pre>\n{\n  \"instances\": [\n    {\n      \"tag\": \"beach\",\n      \"image\": {\"b64\": \"ASa8asdf\"}\n    },\n    {\n      \"tag\": \"car\",\n      \"image\": {\"b64\": \"JLK7ljk3\"}\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</pre>\nFor a graph with input tensor aliases \"tag\" (string) and \"image\"\n(3-dimensional array of 8-bit ints):\n<pre>\n{\n  \"instances\": [\n    {\n      \"tag\": \"beach\",\n      \"image\": [\n        [\n          [138, 30, 66],\n          [130, 20, 56],\n          ...\n        ],\n        [\n          [126, 38, 61],\n          [122, 24, 57],\n          ...\n        ],\n        ...\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"tag\": \"car\",\n      \"image\": [\n        [\n          [255, 0, 102],\n          [255, 0, 97],\n          ...\n        ],\n        [\n          [254, 1, 101],\n          [254, 2, 93],\n          ...\n        ],\n        ...\n      ]\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n</pre>\nIf the call is successful, the response body will contain one prediction\nentry per instance in the request body. If prediction fails for any\ninstance, the response body will contain no predictions and will contian\na single error entry instead.","enum":null,"enumDescriptions":null,"format":null,"id":"GoogleCloudMlV1__PredictRequest","items":null,"location":null,"maximum":null,"minimum":null,"pattern":null,"properties":{"httpBody":{"$ref":"GoogleApi__HttpBody","additionalProperties":null,"annotations":null,"default":null,"description":"\nRequired.
